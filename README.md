## Version Control Rules
- Do not commit to the `main` branch. Create a new branch with branch name being the main feature you are working on and then create a pull request.
- Use commit conventions. Refer [here](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) to learn more about commit conventions. Download the VSCode Conventional Commits Extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) to help make committing messages easier
- Avoid redundant commits. Commit after you have completed a unit of work.
